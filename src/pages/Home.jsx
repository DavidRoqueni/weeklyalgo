        Here at weekly algo we cover a new algorithm every week. These range
        from simple tree structure sorts, to commonly known algorithms, and even
        coding challenge style questions.
        <br />I hope these questions help you learn more about how these
        algorithms work and what it looks like when they opperate with an
        example run of each algorithm.
